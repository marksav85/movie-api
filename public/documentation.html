        <p>The API will use at least three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for reading data from requests and morgan for logging.</p>
        <p>The API will use a “package.json” file.</p>
        <p>The database will be built using MongoDB.</p>
        <p>The business logic will be modeled with Mongoose.</p>
        <p>The API will provide movie information in JSON format.</p>
        <p>The JavaScript code will be error-free.</p>
        <p>The API will be tested in Postman.</p>
